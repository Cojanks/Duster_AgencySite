# Duster_AgencySite

Bootstrap CSS & HTML site for a fictional Martian Ad Agency

CREATIVE BRIEF

BACKGROUND / OVERVIEW: 
With Mars becoming a more self-sustaining economy, the need for local businesses to keep their business local is increasing day by day. With Earth’s data tariffs and delays between communication, local businesses are looking for a more local solution for their advertising needs.

OBJECTIVE:
To educate the Mars population to the Dusters brand. We are a full service advertising agency of Martians for Martians. This website should reflect our Martian roots and educate the viewer to the advantages of choosing a Mars-based agency over a Terrain or Luna-based company.

TARGET AUDIENCE:
Martian-based companies and local businesses. Potential growth opportunities outwards towards the Ceres of Eros colonies in the asteroid belt.

Our audience are individuals and small, local companies who have lineages stretching back to the original 500 settlers. They are proud business owners who invest in their local communities, and devoting any extra resources and manpower towards the local Terraforming projects. They are passionate about their world and are tired of being squeezed by Terrain imposed tariffs on data transfers to/from Earth.


FOCUS:
Dusters: Martian solutions for Martian businesses


REASONS FOR THE CONSUMER TO BUY IN / BELIEVE US:
At the end of the day, our services will always be a cheaper solution compared to our Terrain counterparts. There is also an advantage to being a “boots on the ground”, local business who has the same concerns and understanding of life here on Mars compared to the Art & Creative Directors, living on a wholly different planet.
